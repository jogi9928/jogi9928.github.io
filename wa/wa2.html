        <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Hello, I am a CTD major at CU. I love skiing and dogs, which we have a lot of in Boulder. I am a sophomore and plan on working hard this semester.</p>
            <p>I have no entry knowledge in html and java, but I think my c++ skills will help me along the way.</p>
        <h3>Goals for this Class</h3>
            <p>I would like to learn as much as I can about web design. I find this topic very interesting, combining my skills in computer science/stem with my design interests.</p>
            <p>I hope after this class I'll be able to design a solid website, and once I'm there, starting learning to build algorithms within websites.</p>
